# Old phone keypad
### Overview
This project aims for the Iron Software C# Coding Challenge.

## Project Requirements
an old phone keypad with alphabetical letters, a backspace key, and a send button.
Each button has a number to identify it and pressing a button
multiple times will cycle through the letters on it allowing each button to represent more than one letter.
For example, pressing 2 once will return ‘A’ but pressing twice in succession will return ‘B’.
You must pause for a second in order to type two characters from the same button after each other: “222 2 22” -> “CAB”.
